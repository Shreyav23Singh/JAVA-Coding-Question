In Java, a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of that class. This means you can call a static method on the class itself, without needing to create an instance of the class.
â—¾ðŸ’¥Example :-

class Employee{
 int emp_id;
 String emp_name;
 static String company_name = "Amazon";
 Employee(int id , String name){
  emp_id=id;
  emp_name=name;
 }
 void display(){
  System.out.println(emp_id +" " +emp_name+ " " + company_name);
 }
  public static void main(String[] args){
   Employee E1=new Employee(456 ," Reyanshi");
   Employee E2=new Employee(478 ," Shreya " );
  E1.display();
  E2.display();
 }
}
