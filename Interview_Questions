üí•1Ô∏è‚É£ How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?
üÖ∞Ô∏è JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine, In other words, it is a program/software which takes Java bytecode and converts the byte code (line by line) into machine-understandable code.
‚Ä¢ All these functions take different forms of memory structure. The memory in the JVM is divided into 5 different parts:

‚ô¶Ô∏èClass(Method) Area
‚ô¶Ô∏èHeap
‚ô¶Ô∏èStack
‚ô¶Ô∏èProgram Counter Register
‚ô¶Ô∏èNative Method Stack

üí•2Ô∏è‚É£ . What are the types of exceptions in java?
üÖ∞Ô∏èThere are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. An error is considered an unchecked exception.
‚úîÔ∏èChecked Exceptions (Compile-time Exceptions):
These are exceptions that the compiler requires you to handle. If a method throws a checked exception, the code that calls that method must either catch the exception or declare that it throws the exception.
Examples : IOException , ClassNotFoundException , SQLException
try {
  // code that may throw a checked exception
} catch (IOException e) {
  // handle the exception
}


‚úîÔ∏èUnchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):
These are exceptions that occur at runtime and are not checked by the compiler. Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException or Error.
Examples : NullPointerException , ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ,ArithmeticException

int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException

‚úîÔ∏èError:
Errors are exceptional conditions that are external to the application, and usually, the application cannot handle them. They are subclasses of the Error class.
Examples : OutOfMemoryError , StackOverflowError

üí•3Ô∏è‚É£ . What is enum ?
üÖ∞Ô∏è An enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type that represents a fixed set of constants. It's a way to create a collection of related values that are distinct from each other. 
Enumerations are often used to define a set of named constant values for a variable, providing more meaningful names for those values and enhancing code readability.

// Define an enum named Color
enum Color {
    RED, GREEN, BLUE;
}

public class EnumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Accessing enum constants
        Color myColor = Color.RED;

        // Using a switch statement with enum
        switch (myColor) {
            case RED:
                System.out.println("The color is red.");
                break;
            case GREEN:
                System.out.println("The color is green.");
                break;
            case BLUE:
                System.out.println("The color is blue.");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Unknown color.");
        }

        // Iterating through all enum constants
        System.out.println("All colors:");
        for (Color color : Color.values()) {
            System.out.println(color);
        }
    }
}
